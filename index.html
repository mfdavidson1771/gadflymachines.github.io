    <h2>Focus Areas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Traditions of Thought</strong><br />We use the Socratic method and its derivative ways of pursuing knowledge, both to understand and to build.</li>
      <li><strong>Tools That Question Back</strong><br />We explore how machines, using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, can employ dialectic to produce products for human flourishing.</li>
      <li><strong>Learning Systems, Rethought</strong><br />Beyond platforms or classrooms, we ask what new shapes learning might take when rooted in wonder, critique, and clarity.</li>
      <li><strong>From Provocation to Prototype</strong><br />We follow ideas from first questions to first tools ‚Äî thinking as a mode of building.</li>
    </ul>
