  <em>Διαλεκτική ὡς τρόπος οἰκοδομῆς</em><br />
  <em>Dialectica ut via aedificandi</em><br />
  Dialectic as a Way of Building

  <section>
  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>Gadfly Machines is a workshop where dialectic becomes design — a space where humans and machines reason together to build tools, systems, and services for human flourishing.</p>
  <p>We’re currently in alpha.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Focus Areas</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Traditions of Thought</strong><br />We use the Socratic method and its derivative ways of pursuing knowledge, both to understand and to build.</li>
    <li><strong>Tools That Question Back</strong><br />We explore how machines, using artificial intelligence and machine learning, can employ dialectical methods to produce products and services for human flourishing.</li>
    <li><strong>Learning Systems, Rethought</strong><br />Beyond platforms or classrooms, we ask what new shapes learning might take when rooted in wonder, critique, and clarity.</li>
    <li><strong>From Provocation to Prototype</strong><br />We follow ideas from first questions to first tools — where dialectic becomes design.</li>
  </ul>
</section>



  <section>
    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>Alive. Early-stage. Privately building.</p>
