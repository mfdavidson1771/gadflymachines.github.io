  <p><em>Classical education in a digital age</em></p>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Gadfly Machines is a workshop where the Socratic method meets AI for humans — building thoughtful digital tools and experimental apps.</p>
    <p>We’re currently in alpha.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Focus Areas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Traditions of Thought</strong><br />From the Great Books to the Socratic method, we draw from enduring conversations rather than fixed canons.</li>
      <li><strong>Tools That Question Back</strong><br />We explore how AI and interface design can spark reflection—not just deliver answers.</li>
      <li><strong>Learning Systems, Rethought</strong><br />Beyond platforms or classrooms: what new shapes can learning take when rooted in wonder, critique, and clarity?</li>
      <li><strong>From Provocation to Prototype</strong><br />We follow ideas from first questions to first tools—thinking as a mode of building.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>Alive. Early-stage. Privately building.</p>
